3. Cd to the backend folder and run `python api.py`
4. Next open a new terminal, cd into frontend folder and run `yarn install` (assuming you have node and yarn installed)
5. Once the dependencies are installed, run `yarn start`
6. You can now open the browser and go to `localhost:3000` to try out our application
