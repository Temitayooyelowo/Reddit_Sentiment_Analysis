It's 5 am here and I'm kind of cooked right now off the sauce so I'm probably rambling at this point but I just wanted you to know that I love you all and you're all some very unique people. Being here in this sub is proof enough of that to me. I hope you are all blessed with as many tendies as you can eat. And remember whatever happens it's never aloha we'll always see each other once again boys and girls.,1

"Life isn't fair. My mother always told me that when I would complain about arbitrary treatment. I would play by the rules and someone else would ignore them. When they would win I would appeal to the first authority for an explanation. ""Are you going to let them get away with this""? ""Life isn't fair"". No, it is not. The game is the game. Always.

In this moment, the fascade cracks further. When the first breach was made I do not know, perhaps it was Socrates, but today I see thousands. Millions. 

Once they were laughing, luxuries falling out of their disgusting diseased mouths as they cackled. The unmistakable stench of derision carried on their breath. They told anyone outside of their elite class that we were fools for even trying. They told us that we were naive. We needed networks to be successful. We needed polish. We needed expertise. We needed THEM. The game is the game. Always. 

They are no longer laughing. Their odious oeuvre still wafts through the air. While the rot, and hate, and condescention, remains, the noxious air betrays a new addition. Something all together disconcerting. What it betrays, is fear. They are afraid. And they should be. We do not need their inherited resources masked as acumen. A new day dawns. The day where we make an ever so slight step towards what they fear the most. An even field. Life becoming ever so slighty more fair.   AND. THEY. ARE. SCARED. They look at us and see roughness. We look at them and see softness. We are both correct in our estimation.

The game is the game. Always.

Fuck them in the street. Fuck them all in the street. We are the righteous. We are blessed by Phoebe. What started here will echo through time in the eons to come. Mount up and ride with the fury of a thousand rockets into the universal filament. May the wind always be at your back and the sun upon your face. And may the wings of destiny carry you aloft, to dance with the stars.

"You guys are champs. GME... who would have thought a bunch of crazy retards could reach the front page of the New York Times.

And when you're done with GME, it's time to punish the big banks who have been suppressing the price of silver since the Bear Stearns / JPM merge. It's all in fucking Bloomberg:

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-16/precious-metals-traders-charged-with-rigging-futures-contracts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-16/precious-metals-traders-charged-with-rigging-futures-contracts)

There's an excellent explanation of their scheme here

[https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/palisades-gold-radio/ted-butler-squeezing-out-the-hqxQ5mOdt02/](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/palisades-gold-radio/ted-butler-squeezing-out-the-hqxQ5mOdt02/)

You think GME squeezed hard? Look what happened to silver half a year ago in July:

&#x200B;

That's one of the banks getting squeezed out of silver, having to cover their shorts... and that's just because rich boomers freaked out about financial instability and finally started calling out the Comex on their bullshit, and taking physically delivery of silver... which they don't have.

Now imagine 4 million degenerates buying $SLV, forcing the trust to take delivery of physical silver from the Comex. This isn't GME, who's fair price is maybe around $5 a share. The FAIR price of silver based on the historical gold/silver ratio is almost surely over $50/ounce. This short squeeze will be a fantastic success even if we can take silver to it's fair market value.

And then there's $AG. Because once silver starts moving, $AG is going to go to the fucking moon. 1) it's a leverage play on silver, 2) It's got it's OWN SHORTS TO BE SQUEEZED OUT. At least a 23% short float as of last count: [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm)

**TL;DR: Once this thing gets going, shares and calls of $SLV and $AG will** ***rocket.***

"This is our time. If anyone will listen to you, please explain to them why GME is one of the very best investments they can make right now. I have already gotten 5 people close to me to research what is happening and they decided to dump everything into GME. NOT AMC, NOT NOK, NOT BB, but GME. After last night's AH manipulation I am not selling until at least 5k to 10k a share. We need to encourage people to have the courage to hold. We finally have the power to change our futures. They want us begging again and again for stimulus checks while they laugh at us as they sip champaign from gold plated glasses. We are a fucking joke to them. Well, now, how the fuck does it feel? This is our chance at financial freedom. This is our moment. Fellow poors! Rise up! We will be enslaved no more!",1

"They have tweeted to their millions of followers. It's not just us anymore everyone is watching. This is historic. Don't sell until high 4 figures and let's make this count 

IF MELVIN BECOMES BANKRUPT THEIR BROKER HAS TO COVER IF THEIR BROKER BECOMES BANKRUPT THEIR BANKS HAVE TO COVER -> SHORTS MUST REPAY IN THE END SHORTS CAN SEE OUR LIMITS. THEY PAY ROBINHOOD FOR EXACTLY THIS TYPE OF DATA!! BUY THE DIP IN THE AM AND SET A LIMIT ORDER FOR 6942.00!!!!

I like this stock!

My gf likes this stock!

"Most of you know nothing of the legend of Marty Moho.  One of the true original kings of wsb.  He had a dream...a dream of an idaho-based semi-conductor company chaufferring him to valhalla in a gold-plated lambo.  I rolled in Marty's gang back in the day, before i was /u/andrewwkpartyparty2.  A silent partner, i followed him every step of the way, doubling down, buying all the dips.  It didn't work out and i blew up my ally account, but that's how it goes sometimes.  You live and you learn.  I know you new apetards are sad about your stupid squeeze DD and your $600 GME losses, but none of you are autistic enough to be worthy of carrying Marty's elephant-sized jockstrap.  

MU has finally hit $90 and i take back most of the mean things i said about Sanjay, except for the racist and homophobic stuff because that testicle-tickling goatfucker cost me a lot of money over the years.

In summation, buy a MU leap today, or don't.  I don't care.  But definitely take a minute to honor Marty",1
"If you’re like me, you’re fucking sick of those bastards at RH and want your money out. But what’s that? You don’t want your 💎 🤚 GME positions locked up for a couple of weeks in case that 🚀 decides to get unstuck from the mud, you fellow bag holder?

Well, I finally did my DD and learned I can move all my other positions out of RH so GME isn’t locked in limbo. 

The process starts with your new broker. For me, I’m with Vanguard and just initiated the transfer process for my other investments with RH. 

Note that having contracts or margin in play will complicate things. 

Don’t wait. Get the fuck out of RH. 

This isn’t financial advice. Just my retarded opinion and experience on how to move your bags, ahem, tendies to a real brokerage.",-1
"Has he lost his mind?

Can he sell or is he blind?

Can he hold it all?

Or if price drops will he fall?

Is he alive or dead?

Has he thoughts of gamestonk bread?

We’ll just watch it there

Why should Cramer even care?

His balls turned to steel

In the great short squeeze field

When he held the line

For the future of ape-kind

Nobody wants him

He just stares at the swirl

Planning to YOLO

Your wife’s necklace he pearls

Now, the time is here

For Tendie Man to spread cheer

Vengeance from GME

Kills the Melvins as they flee

Nobody holds it

They just paper their hands

Nobody helped him

Now, he has Tendie Lands

Heavy boots of lead

Fills his tendie margin treads

Mooning as fast as they can

Tendie Man lives again",-1
